# yengec-casestudy

This app created for frontend position at Yengec.

# Notes

- Repository configuration is not completed. Its current state just gives an idea of how to use repositories in nuxt.
- Current vuex store doesn't imply how to structure an app. The structure only shows how to create namespaced modules.
